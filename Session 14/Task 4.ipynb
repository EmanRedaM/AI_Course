    "One practical use for probability distributions and scenario analysis in business is to predict future levels of sales. It is essentially impossible to predict the precise value of a future sales level; however, businesses still need to be able to plan for future events. Using a scenario analysis based on a probability distribution can help a company frame its possible future values in terms of a likely sales level and a worst-case and best-case scenario. By doing so, the company can base its business plans on the likely scenario but still be aware of the alternative possibilities.\n",

    "In addition to predicting future sales levels, probability distribution can be a useful tool for evaluating risk. Consider, for example, a company considering entering a new business line. If the company needs to generate 500,000 in revenue in order to break evenand their probability distribution tells them that there is a 10 percent chance that revenues will be less than $500,000 "
